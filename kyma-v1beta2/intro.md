Welcome to modular Kyma!

In this interactive tutorial, you will learn how to enable kyma module(s) and use them in your cluster! You will also learn how to easily interact with them based on terminal and in [Busola, our own UI for your Kyma experience](https://dashboard.kyma.cloud.sap/clusters).

For your convenience we are now preparing your very own Kyma Control Plane installed by our [cli](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli).

This includes a deployment of [Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/kyma-project/lifecycle-manager) that is already preconfigured. We also apply some special cluster privileges to it so that you can work with your modules without any issues, so enjoy!

For more detail on what is happening right now, you can always run `kyma alpha deploy --help`. There will be many options to kustomize your deployment which you can use in your very own testing environment outside of this test scenario.

For now, wait until Kyma Control Plane (lifecycle-manager) is installed.
